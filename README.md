# NP Schedulability Test

This repository contains the implementation of the **schedulability tests** for sets of **non-preemptive jobs** scheduled upon **uni- or multiprocessors** presented in the papers

- M. Nasri and B. Brandenburg, “[An Exact and Sustainable Analysis of Non-Preemptive Scheduling](https://people.mpi-sws.org/~bbb/papers/pdf/rtss17.pdf)”, *Proceedings of the 38th IEEE Real-Time Systems Symposium (RTSS 2017)*, December 2017, and

- M. Nasri, G. Nelissen, and B. Brandenburg, “[A Response-Time Analysis for Non-Preemptive Job Sets under Global Scheduling](http://drops.dagstuhl.de/opus/frontdoor.php?source_opus=8994)”, *Proceedings of the 30th Euromicro Conference on Real-Time Systems (ECRTS 2018)*, July 2018.


The uniprocessor analysis (Nasri & Brandenburg, 2017) is exact; the multiprocessor analysis (Nasri et al., 2018) is not. 

## Dependencies

- A modern C++ compiler supporting the **C++14 standard**. Recent versions of `clang` and `g++` on Linux and macOS are known to work. 

- The [CMake](https://cmake.org) build system.

- A POSIX OS. Linux and macOS are both known to work.

## Build Instructions

These instructions assume a Linux or macOS host.

To compile the tool, first generate an appropriate `Makefile` with `cmake` and then use it to actually build the source tree.

	# (1) enter the build directory
	cd build
	# (2) generate the Makefile
	cmake ..
	# (3) build everything
	make -j

The last step yields two binaries:

- `nptest`, the actually schedulability analysis tool, and
- `runtests`, the unit test suite (described next). 

## Unit Tests

The tool comes with a test driver (based on [C++ doctest](https://github.com/onqtam/doctest)) named `runtests`. After compiling everything, just run the tool to make sure everything works. 

```
$ ./runtests 
[doctest] doctest version is "1.2.1"
[doctest] run with "--help" for options
===============================================================================
[doctest] test cases:     27 |     27 passed |      0 failed |      0 skipped
[doctest] assertions:    260 |    260 passed |      0 failed |
[doctest] Status: SUCCESS!
```

**Note**: the multiprocessor analysis currently fails two tests because it is only sound, but not precise. This is known and ok.


## Input Format

The tool operates on CSV files with a fixed column order. Each input CSV file is expected to contain a set of jobs, where each row specifies one job. The following columns are expected.

1.   **Task ID** — an arbitrary numeric ID to identify the task to which a job belongs
2.   **Job ID** — a unique numeric ID that identifies the job
3.   **Arrival min** — the earliest-possible release time of the job
4.   **Arrival max** — the latest-possible release time of the job
5.   **Cost min** — the best-case execution time of the job (can be zero)
6.   **Cost max** — the worst-case execution time of the job
7.   **Deadline** — the absolute deadline of the job
8.   **Priority** — the priority of the job (EDF: set it equal to the deadline)

All numeric parameters can be 64-bit integers (preferred) or floating point values (slower, not recommended). 

For example input files, see the files in the `examples/` folder (e.g., [examples/fig1a.csv](examples/fig1a.csv)).

## Analyzing a Job Set

To run the tool on a given job set, just pass the filename as an argument. For example:

```
$ build/nptest examples/fig1a.csv 
examples/fig1a.csv,  0,  9,  6,  5,  1,  0.000329,  820.000000,  0
```

The output format is explained below.  

If no input files are provided, or if `-` is provided as an input file name, `nptest` will read the job set description from standard input, which allows applying filters etc. For example:

```
$ cat examples/fig1a.csv | grep -v '3, 9' | build/nptest 
-,  1,  8,  9,  8,  0,  0.000069,  816.000000,  0
```

To activate an *idle-time insertion policy* (IIP, see paper for details), use the `-i` option. For example, to use the CW-EDF IIP, pass the `-i CW` option:

```
$ build/nptest -i CW examples/fig1a.csv 
examples/fig1a.csv,  1,  9,  10,  9,  0,  0.000121,  848.000000,  0, 1
```

When analyzing a job set with **dense-time parameters** (i.e., time values specified as floating-point numbers), the option `-t dense` **must** be passed. 

To use the multiprocessor analysis, use the `-m` option. 

See the builtin help (`nptest -h`) for further options.

### AER job sets

To analyse a job set which adheres to the AER (3-phase) model use the `-i AER`
option. This defaults to assume a single-core architecture. To specify more
than one core use the `-m` option in combination.

The AER analysis puts some additional constraints on format of the input. The
ID's of the jobs are used to identify whether a job is the Acquisition phase or
the Restitution phase. Even ID*'s represent jobs that are Acquisition phases
and odd ID's represent jobs that are Restitution phases.

The job ID's are also constrained to be organised in pairs with A and R phases
corresponding to the same actual job as such:

Job ID: (1, 2),(3, 4),(5, 6),(7, 8)
Phase:   A  R   A  R   A  R   A  R

## Output Format

The output is provided in CSV format and consists of the following columns:

1. The input file name.
2. The schedulability result: 1 if the job is is schedulable, 0 if it is not (or if an inexact analysis can't prove it to be schedulable).
3. The number of jobs in the job set.
4. The number of states that were explored.
5. The number of edges that were discovered. 
6. The maximum “exploration front width” of the schedule graph, which is the maximum number of unprocessed states  that are queued for exploration (at any point in time). 
7. The CPU time used in the analysis (in seconds).
8. The peak amount of memory used (as reported by `getrusage()`), divided by 1024. Due to non-portable differences in `getrusage()`, on Linux this reports the memory usage in megabytes, whereas on macOS it reports the memory usage in kilobytes.
9. A timeout indicator: 1 if the state-space exploration was aborted due to reaching the time limit (as set with the `-l` option); 0 otherwise. 
10. The number of processors assumed during the analysis.
